**How I Built This Project**

I created this Myntra Clone using HTML and CSS to practice front-end web development. The goal was to understand website layout structuring, responsive design, and UI styling. This project helped me enhance my skills in:

. HTML structuring: Creating semantic and well-organized web pages

. CSS styling: Implementing attractive designs with proper styling techniques

. Flexbox and Grid: Making the layout responsive and user-friendly
